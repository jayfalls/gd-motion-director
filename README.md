A huge shout-out to the projects who were generous enough to release their code under MIT License as to allow me to use and take inspiration for my project.
### Dependencies
[GD-Action](https://github.com/duongvituan/godot-action-animation-framework)
All the animations are handled by this awesome plugin.

[Godot Sprite Shader](https://github.com/duongvituan/godot-sprite-shader)
This provides almost all the default shaders.

This project was the inspiration for what I've built. As well as helping me discover GDAction, I also took some shaders from here.
